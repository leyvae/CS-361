Group 43 Ground Rules
1. We will mainly be communicating through Discord. Meetings will be at
least once a week or whenever necessary.
2. We will be expected to respond to messages within at least 24 hours to
make sure any issues are resolved quickly.
3. Any confusion about project requirements must be brought up as soon as
possible to prevent progress from stalling.
4. If there is some emergency situation where a member can not fulfill their
part of the work in the project, the other member must be informed as early
as possible so a mitigation plan can be set up.
5. Any criticisms about the project plan or project implementation should be
made constructively and for the purpose of improving one another
projects. We will maintain a space where communication is free and
everyone is comfortable sharing ideas.
